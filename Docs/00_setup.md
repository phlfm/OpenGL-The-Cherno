# GLFW

Is a very lightweight framework that allows us to detect events such as keyboard input, mouse input, and other sort of inputs, but more importantly, it allows you to create a render window in which you can render your code, as OpenGL doesn't have a way of creating a rendering window, and it needs something like GLFW to create it.


# GLEW

GLEW is the OpenGL Extension Wrangler, which basically allows you to use OpenGL functions that are new, or more precisely, non-core. It provides systematic mechanisms during runtime to determine which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform. For any new functions, you essentially require something like OpenGL Extension Wrangler to initialize extensions and to write portable applications.
